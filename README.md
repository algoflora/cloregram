## Obtaining certificates
- In deploy folder create **ssl** folder: `mkdir ssl`
- Jump inside it: `cd ssl`
- Create certificate and private key. Fill in Country, State/Province, Locality and Organisation as you see fit. **CN** field is for IP-address or domain where bot is deploying. `openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout private.key -x509 -days 365 -out cert.pem -subj "/C=LK/ST=Southern Province/L=Kathaluwa/O=Weedbreed/CN=127.0.0.1"`
- Obtain PKCS12 certificate from our keys: `openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.pem -inkey private.key -out certificate.p12 -name "certificate"` It will ask you to come up with a password. It will be needed in next step.
- Create JKS keystore: `keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore certificate.p12 -srcstoretype pkcs12 -destkeystore keystore.jks` At first you will be asked about new keystore password. By default Cloregram using **cloregram.keystorepass**. Next step you have to enter password from previous step.
- Now you can delete **certificate.p12** and **private.key**: `rm certificate.p12 private.key`

Files **cert.pem** and **keystore.jks** as well as **ssl** folder can be diferent. Just then you need to specify in the config fields **:bot/server :options :keystore** (default to **ssl/keystore.jks**) and **:bot/instance :certificate** (default to **ssl/cert.pem**). As well you can set keystore password different from **cloregram.keystorepass** by specifying field **:bot/server :options :keystore-password**.
